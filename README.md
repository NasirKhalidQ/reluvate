### Login Page

Login page just redirects to /catch-pokemon after entering any values and clicking the login button. There is no authentication here and successful login mimics network request using timeout so success toast can be displayed for a while

### Catch Pokemon

Catch Pokemon button redirects to /catch-pokemon page. It initializes the game with 3 tries, a random number is generated for guessing and a random pokemon is displayed from a list of 16 pokemons. Pokemon card is displayed with details such as hp, etc.

A number must be input for guessing. A toast is displayed with error if number is incorrect and success message if the guessed number by user matches the randomly generated number at start. Buttons are available to change difficulty level to easy(1-10), medium(1=100) or hard(1-1000). A confetti animation runs for 6 seconds if a pokemon is captured.

### View Pokemon

User can view the pokemons collected by clicking the view pokemon button in the navbar. This page uses the same pokemon card component from catch pokemon page along with displaying a level betweeen 1-100 generated during pokemon capture. I have also added an extra option to delete a pokemon lest the user does not need it.
